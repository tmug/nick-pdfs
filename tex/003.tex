\section*{Problem}
Two perfect logicians, S and P, are told that integers \( x \) and \( y \)
have been chosen such that \( 1 < x < y \) and \( x + y < 100 \). S is
given the value \( x + y \) and P is given the value \( xy \). They then
have the following conversation.

\setlength{\leftskip}{2em}
P:  I cannot determine the two numbers. \\
S:  I knew that. \\
P:  Now I can determine them. \\
S:  So can I.
\setlength{\leftskip}{0em}

Given that the above statements are true, what are the two numbers?
(Computer assistance allowed.)

\section*{Solution}
This problem is solved using a computer program written in Python. The
program and its output, respectively, are available at the following
URLs:
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{https://github.com/sunainapai/lab/blob/master/math/nick/003.py}
\item \url{https://github.com/sunainapai/lab/blob/master/math/nick/003.txt}
\end{itemize}

The program and the output are also included in the next two sections.

The output shows that the solution is
\begin{align*}
x & = 4 \\
y & = 13
\end{align*}
